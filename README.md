# CLIP Image Embeddings Analysis
# -------------------------------

# This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of image embeddings generated by the CLIP
# (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model in clustering similar images together.
# The primary objective is to assess whether the CLIP model can effectively capture
# semantic similarities between images and facilitate meaningful clustering.

## Project Overview

# The project utilizes the CLIP model, a state-of-the-art vision-language transformer,
# to generate image embeddings that encode semantic information about the images in
# a high-dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE) are then
# employed to visualize the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space, and clustering
# algorithms (K-means) are applied to group similar images together based on their
# embeddings.

# The main challenge lies in effectively capturing the rich semantic information
# present in images and translating it into meaningful embeddings, as well as selecting
# appropriate hyperparameters for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms.

## Dataset

# The project utilizes a subset of the Google Open Images dataset, which contains a
# diverse collection of annotated images spanning various categories.

## Approach

# 1. Load and preprocess images: The images from the specified directory are loaded
#    and preprocessed for input to the CLIP model.

# 2. Extract image features: The CLIP model is used to extract image features,
#    generating embeddings that capture semantic information about the images.

# 3. Dimensionality reduction and visualization: The t-SNE algorithm is applied to
#    reduce the dimensionality of the image embeddings, enabling visualization in a
#    lower-dimensional space.

# 4. Clustering: The K-means clustering algorithm is employed to group the images
#    into clusters based on their embeddings, with the goal of grouping similar
#    images together.

# 5. Evaluation: The clustering results are evaluated using metrics such as the
#    silhouette score, which measures the cohesion and separation of the clusters.

# 6. Analysis and visualization: The project provides tools for analyzing
#    domain-specific insights and introducing challenging data (e.g., noisy) to
#    observe its impact on clustering. Visualizations are generated to aid in the
#    interpretation of the results.

## Results

# The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CLIP model in generating
# semantically rich representations that enable meaningful image clustering. The
# t-SNE visualization (Image 1) shows that images with similar semantic content
# tend to form loosely clustered groups, indicating that the CLIP model captures
# meaningful semantic relationships between images.

# The clustered image embeddings visualization (Image 2) illustrates the results
# of applying K-means clustering to the t-SNE projected embeddings. Well-defined
# and relatively separated clusters can be observed, suggesting that the K-means
# algorithm successfully grouped together images with shared semantic features
# based on their CLIP embeddings.

# The silhouette score, a measure of clustering quality, is also computed and
# displayed, providing quantitative validation of the clustering performance.

## Usage

# 1. Clone the repository.
# 2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# 3. Update the `image_dir` variable in the `model.py` file to point to the directory
#    containing your images.
# 4. Run the `model.py` script: `python model.py`.

# The script will load the images, extract features using the CLIP model, perform
# t-SNE dimensionality reduction, apply K-means clustering, and display the results,
# including visualizations and the silhouette score.

# Additionally, you can uncomment the relevant lines in the `model.py` script to
# analyze domain-specific insights or introduce challenging data and observe its
# impact on clustering.
