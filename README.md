# CLIP Image Embeddings Analysis
# -------------------------------

# This project evaluates the efficacy of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model-generated image embeddings in clustering similar images together. The primary goal is to assess whether the CLIP model effectively captures semantic similarities between images and facilitates meaningful clustering.

## Project Overview

# The project employs the CLIP model, a state-of-the-art vision-language transformer, to generate image embeddings encoding semantic information about the images in a high-dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE) are utilized to visualize the embeddings in a lower-dimensional space, followed by applying clustering algorithms (K-means) to group similar images together based on their embeddings.

# Challenges include capturing rich semantic information in images, selecting appropriate hyperparameters for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms.

## Dataset

# A subset of the Google Open Images dataset, containing annotated images spanning various categories, is used for evaluation.

## Approach

# 1. Load and preprocess images: Images from the specified directory are loaded and preprocessed for input to the CLIP model.
# 2. Extract image features: The CLIP model extracts image features, generating embeddings capturing semantic information.
# 3. Dimensionality reduction and visualization: t-SNE algorithm reduces dimensionality for visualization in a lower-dimensional space.
# 4. Clustering: K-means clustering groups images into clusters based on embeddings.
# 5. Evaluation: Clustering results are evaluated using metrics like the silhouette score.
# 6. Analysis and visualization: Tools are provided for domain-specific insights and introducing challenging data.

## Results

# The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CLIP model in generating semantically rich representations enabling meaningful image clustering. The visualizations and silhouette score validate the clustering performance.

## Usage

# 1. Clone the repository.
# 2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# 3. Update `image_dir` in `model.py` to point to your image directory.
# 4. Run `model.py`: `python model.py`.

# The script loads images, extracts features, performs t-SNE dimensionality reduction, applies K-means clustering, and displays results including visualizations and the silhouette score.
